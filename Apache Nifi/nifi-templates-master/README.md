# NiFiTemplates
A collection of templates for use with Apache NiFi and an excel file which indicates what processors/controller services are in each template. This collection is meant to be a place for users to come to see how processors are configured or potentially used. As well as for developers to have easy access to templates to test their changes with.

The counts along the top of the excel file indicate how many templates currently use that processor.

# Verification
These templates are compiled from many different sources so some flows have undergone more verification than others.
At the very least, each of them have been successfully imported into an Apache NiFi instance. 

# Contributing
All templates are welcome to be added to this directory. In the future there is the goal to have 100% coverage of processors and controller services. If you have a template you'd like to add just open a pull request.
