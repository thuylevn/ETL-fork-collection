=======

0.18.0 (2021-11-29)
-------------------

| Updated client for NiFi & Registry 1.15.0 release

* Moved testing to secured single user by default for NiFi
* Consolidated clients to the 1.15.0 release version for both NiFi and Registry
* Updated logic to support changed working modes in tests
* Corrected minor functional issues for 1.15 in login handling, SSL certs, Parameter Updates and Testing
* Backwards compatibility and Regression tested as requiring no breaking changes

0.17.1 (2021-10-21)
-------------------

| Added gzip as default request header (PR from rsaggino)
| Update ruamel.yaml to 0.17.16
| Update file read/write to explicitly handle encoding, default to UTF8, configurable in nipyapi.config
| Linting and style changes to update to Python 3.9 standards, except where it would break backwards compatibility to Python 2.7
| Test support for Amazon Linux 2, mostly better error handling for filesystem responses

0.17.0 (2021-10-13)
-------------------

| Updated NiFi version and client to 1.13.2
| Updated NiFi-Registry version and client to 0.8.0

* Note that these are the last versions where NiFi and NiFi-Registry are separate codebases

0.16.3 (2021-10-11)
-------------------

| Removed force reset of configuration.password and configuration.username to empty string. This was not increasing security, and was causing unexpected errors for users connecting to multiple services in a single script.
| Add greedy control to versioning.get_registry_bucket and versioning.get_flow_in_bucket to avoid undesirable partial string match.

* Update readme to reflect switch from 'master' branch naming to 'main'.
* Update tox to pin testing to Python 3.8, as Python 3.9 is producing unexpected and unrelated SSL failures
* Minor lint formatting improvements

0.16.2 (2021-02-10)
-------------------

| NOTE: If you are using secured Registry, this release will enforce access controls for the swagger interface which is used to determine which version of Registry is connected in order to correctly provide features - you may have to update your authorizations

* Update requirements.txt to unpin future and lxml
* Update lxml to 4.6.2 or newer to resolve vulnerability
* Pin watchdog to <1.0.0 per their docs to maintain Python2.7 compatibility
* Revert 0.14.3 changes to Authentication handling which introduced basicAuth support but resulted in some NiFi connections appearing incorrectly as Anonymous
* Added simpler basicAuth control to force it via a config switch without changing tokenAuth and other Authorization header behavior during normal usage
* nipyapi.config.global_force_basic_auth is now available for use for this purpose
* Secured Registry users will now require the authorization policy to retrieve the swagger so we may use it to validate which version of
* Registry is in use for feature enablement
* Moved all Security controls in config.py to a common area at the foot of the file
* Removed auth_type from security.service_login as it is now redundant
* Added controls to handle certificate checking behavior which has become more strict in recently versions of Python3, ssl_verify and check_hostname are now handled
* security.set_service_auth_token now has an explicit flag for ssl host checking as well
* Fix oversight where improved model serialisation logic was not correctly applied to Registry
* Removed unusused parameter refresh from parameters.update_parameter_context
* Reduced unecessary complexity in utils.dump with no change in functionality
* Updated client gen mustache templates to reflect refactored security and api client code
* Minor linting and docstring and codestyle improvements
* Set pyUp to ignore Watchdog as it must stay between versions to statisfy py2 and py3 compatibility
* If Client is not instantiated, optimistically instantiate for version checking
* add socks proxy support

0.10.0 (2018-08-03)
-------------------

| Updated NiFi client for 1.7.1 release
| Updated NiFi-Registry client for 0.2.0 release

**Key Changes**

* Reworked NiFi-Registry pytest setup to support multiple versions
* Changed schedule_processor to use component. rather than status. tests as they are more reliable
* Swtiched Docker configs to use explicit versions instead of latest for more consistent behavior across environents

**Version Changes**

* Deprecated testing against NiFi-1.5.0 due to host headers issue - recommend users to upgrade to at least NiFi-1.6.0
* Deprecated testing against NiFi-1.4.0 as superfluous
* Added testing for NiFi-1.7.1 and NiFi-Registry-0.2.0


0.9.1 (2018-05-18)
------------------

| Updated Demos for 0.9 release

**New Features**

* Added a new demo for Flow Development LifeCycle which illustrates the steps a user might automate to promote Versioned Flows between NiFi environments
* Check out nipyapi.demo.fdlc to see more details

0.9.0 (2018-05-16)
------------------

| Updated NiFi client to 1.6.0 release

**Potentially Breaking Changes**

*Users should check the updated documentation and ensure their tests pass as expected*

* Several NiFi client API calls were inconsistently CamelCase'd and have been renamed in the upstream NiFi release, I have honoured those changes in this release. If you use them please check your function names if you get an error

**New Features**

* Added functionality to Deploy a versioned flow to the canvas. This was an oversight from the 0.8.0 release. Function is creatively named ./versioning/deploy_flow_version

**Other Notes**

* Updated the Issue Template to also ask how urgent the problem is so we can priortise work
* Where possible we have switched to using the Apache maintained Docker containers rather than our own, there should be no impact to this unless you were relying on some edge part of our test compose files


0.8.0 (2018-03-06)
------------------

| Introducing Secured environment support, vastly expanded Versioning support including import/export.
| Fixed Templates, better documentation, more demos, and NiFi version backtesting.

**Potentially Breaking Changes**

*Users should check the updated documentation and ensure their tests pass as expected*

* Import/Export of Flow Versions was reworked significantly and renamed to correct bugs and remove coding complications and be generally more obvious in its behavior
* Template upload/download reworked significantly to remove direct reliance on requests and correct bugs in some environments
* Reworked many list/get functions to be more standardised as we stabilise the approaches to certain tasks. This should not change again in future
* Standardised bad user submission on AssertionError, bad API submission errors on ValueError, and general API errors on ApiException. This standard should flow forwards
* Switched ruamel.yaml from >15 to <15 as advised in the project documentation, as >15 is not considered production ready

**Known Issues**

* Python2 environments with older versions of openssl may run into errors like 'SSLV3_ALERT_HANDSHAKE_FAILURE' when working in secured environments. This is not a NiPyApi bug, it's a problem with py2/openssl which is fixed by either upgrading openssl or moving to Python3 like you know you should

**New Features**

* Added support for working with secured NiFi environments, contributed by KevDoran
    * Added demo compatibility between secured_connection and console to produce a rich secured and version-controlled demo environment
    * Added many secured environment convenience functions to security.py
    * Integrated tokenAuth support throughout the low-level clients
* Added simple Docker deployment support in utils module for test, demo, and development
* Standardised all documentation on more readable docstrings and rst templates across the entire codebase
* Significantly expanded versioning support, users should consult the refreshed documentation
* Added experimental support for cleaning queues, process_groups, and setting scheduling of various components
* Many calls now have an auto-refresh before action option to simplify applying changes
* Implemented short and long wait controls for relevant functions to allow more deterministic changes
* Implemented generic object-list-filtering-for-a-string-in-a-field for many response get/list types
* Standardised many responses to conform to a common response contract: None for none, object for single, and list-of-objects for many
* Implemented import/export to json/yaml in versioning
* Added regression/backtesting for many functions going back through major release versions to NiFi-1.1.2. More details will be obvious from reading tests/conftest.py
* Test suites now more reliably clean up after themselves when executed on long-running environments
* Apparently logging is popular, so standard Python logging is now included

**Other notes**

* Various low-level SDK bugfixes corrected in the swagger spec and updated in the provided client
* Enhanced Template and Flow Versioning to handle significantly more complex flows
* Significantly enhanced testing fixtures
* Refactored several common functions to utils.py, and moved several common configurations to config.py
